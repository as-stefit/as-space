# as-space

A Java library for managing rockets and missions.

## Assumptions

- Rocket and Mission names must be unique across the system â€” they serve as identifiers.
- Each newly created rocket starts with a default status: `ON_GROUND`.
- Each newly created mission starts with a default status: `SCHEDULED`.
- Business logic (e.g., validation of duplicates) is handled at the service layer, not the repository.
- The in-memory repository is the current persistence mechanism, and it may be replaced in the future by a persistent
  database.
- Rockets already assigned to mission cannot be assigned to new mission.
- Rockets and Missions have to be created first in order to be managed.
- Rockets `ON_GROUND` can be changed to `IN_REPAIR` by service.
- Rockets `ON_GROUND` can be changed to `IN_SPACE` by only assigning to mission.
- Rocket can be assigned to mission one by one, or multiple at once.
- If it's needed to verify if rocket assignment to mission was successful, use one by one method. For multiple
  assignment, no exception is thrown for nonexistent / already assigned rockets.
- Mission statuses are managed by changing rocket statuses. The only direct mission status change possible is to finish mission (set ENDED status).
- TDD is followed for each new feature.

## How to use

### Rocket creation

To create a new rocket, use the `createNewRocket` method in the `RocketService` class:

```java
RocketService service = new RocketService(new InMemoryRocketRepository());
Rocket rocket = service.createNewRocket("Red Dragon");
```

### Mission creation

To create a new mission, use the `createNewMission` method in the `MissionService` class:

```java
MissionService service = new MissionService(new InMemoryMissionRepository());
Mission mission = service.createNewMission("Mars");
```

### Resource Management

To assign rocket to mission, use the `assignRocketToMission` method in the `ManagementService` class:

```java
import as.space.repository.InMemoryRocketRepository;

ManagementService service = new ManagementService(new InMemoryRocketRepository(), new InMemoryMissionRepository());
service.assignRocketToMission("Red Dragon","Mars");
```

To assign multiple rockets at once to mission, use the `assignRocketsToMission` method in the `ManagementService` class:

```java
import as.space.repository.InMemoryRocketRepository;

ManagementService service = new ManagementService(new InMemoryRocketRepository(), new InMemoryMissionRepository());
service.assignRocketsToMission(List.of("Red Dragon", "Blue Dragon"), "Mars");
```

To change rocket status, use the `changeRocketStatus` method in the `ManagementService` class:

```java
import as.space.repository.InMemoryRocketRepository;

ManagementService service = new ManagementService(new InMemoryRocketRepository(), new InMemoryMissionRepository());
service.changeRocketStatus("Red Dragon",RocketStatus.IN_REPAIR);
```

To finish mission, use the `finishMission` method in the `ManagementService` class:

```java
import as.space.repository.InMemoryRocketRepository;

ManagementService service = new ManagementService(new InMemoryRocketRepository(), new InMemoryMissionRepository());
service.finishMission("Mars");
```
